# Peer: A Decentralized Platform for Scientific Publication and Peer Review
Welcome to Peer, a revolutionary web3 platform designed to transform the landscape of scientific publishing by harnessing the power of blockchain technology and community governance. At Peer, researchers can upload their scientific papers, receive immediate legitimacy checks through our on-chain AI powered by Galadriel, and engage in community-driven peer review.

## Features
* **On-Chain AI Validation**: Every paper submitted is automatically verified for legitimacy by cutting-edge AI, powered by Galadriel, running directly on the blockchain.
* **Community Voting System**: Uploaded papers are subjected to community review on "talk.online", where users cast votes to determine the quality and validity of the research.
* **Reward Mechanism**: Authors whose papers are accepted receive monetary rewards from a central pool, which is funded by donors and distributed quarterly.
* **Citation-Based Rewards**: Beyond a basic equal distribution when funds are limited, additional rewards are distributed based on the number of citations a paper receives, incentivizing quality and impactful research.

## How It Works
1. **Upload Your Paper**: Authors can upload their papers directly on Peer.
2. **AI Verification**: Papers undergo an automatic legitimacy check via Galadriel's on-chain AI.
3. **Community Review**: Papers are then posted on "talk.online" for community voting. A paper needs at least 5 votes to be considered for acceptance.
4. **Acceptance and Reward Distribution**: If the community approves a paper, it is officially published on Peer. Authors are rewarded quarterly from a central pool. The distribution depends on the total funds available:
    - **Equal Distribution**: If funds are below a certain threshold, all qualifying authors receive an equal share.
    - **Citation-Based Distribution**: Excess funds are distributed proportionally based on the number of citations each paper receives.

## Technology Stack
* **React**: For building a dynamic and responsive front-end user interface.
* **Solidity**: Utilized for smart contracts that manage the AI verification, voting, and reward distribution mechanisms.
* **Blockchain**: Ensures transparency, security, and integrity of all transactions and data.
